# Specification Quality Checklist: Test Infrastructure Expansion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: PASS
- Spec focuses on infrastructure needs from test perspective (user need)
- Written to describe what capabilities are needed, not how to implement
- No code references, only service capabilities and test requirements
- All mandatory sections present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**: PASS
- No clarification markers present
- All FR requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "Docker Compose environment MUST include Apache Iceberg REST Catalog service")
- Success criteria are all measurable (test completion rates, execution times, performance metrics)
- Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., "Developers can execute...in under 10 minutes" not "Docker should...")
- Each user story has 4-6 acceptance scenarios covering key flows
- Edge cases cover failure scenarios, resource limits, and race conditions
- Scope clearly bounded in "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

**Feature Readiness**: PASS
- Each FR maps to user stories via priority grouping
- 5 prioritized user stories cover: Iceberg (P1), Delta (P2), Schema Registry (P3), Debezium connectors (P4), Alertmanager config (P5)
- Success criteria align with user stories (test enablement, execution performance, data consistency)
- No implementation leaks (Docker images mentioned in Dependencies section, not Requirements)
