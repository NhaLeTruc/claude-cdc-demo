# Specification Quality Checklist: Test Infrastructure Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Pass**: All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Strengths

1. **Clear User Stories**: Each story has well-defined priority, rationale, and independent test scenarios
2. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 10 functional requirements, 5 data quality requirements, all testable
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 8 specific metrics with quantifiable targets (test counts, timing, resource usage)
4. **Well-Defined Scope**: Clear in/out scope boundaries prevent scope creep
5. **Risk Assessment**: 5 risks identified with mitigation strategies
6. **Technology-Agnostic**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (test execution time, failure counts) not implementation

### Areas Addressed

- **No Clarifications Needed**: All requirements are specific and unambiguous based on current test suite analysis
- **Testable Requirements**: Each FR/DQ requirement maps to specific test validation
- **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases identified covering resource constraints, concurrency, and compatibility
- **Dependencies**: Infrastructure, service, and test dependencies clearly documented

## Status

âœ… **READY FOR PLANNING** - Specification meets all quality criteria and can proceed to `/speckit.plan`
