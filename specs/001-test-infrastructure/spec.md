# Feature Specification: Test Infrastructure Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-test-infrastructure`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add missing infrastructure (Spark, AlertManager, etc.) to enable skipped/failed tests"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Runs Full Test Suite Successfully (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the CDC demo project, I need to run the complete test suite locally to validate my changes before committing code. Currently, many tests are skipped or failing due to missing infrastructure components.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for development workflow quality. Without a complete local testing environment, developers cannot validate their work, leading to production bugs and broken CI/CD pipelines.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `make test` and verifying that previously skipped Delta Lake/Spark tests now execute successfully, demonstrating that Spark infrastructure is functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer has docker-compose running, **When** they execute `make test`, **Then** all Delta Lake writer tests execute (not skipped) and can write data to Delta tables
2. **Given** the developer has made changes to Delta Lake code, **When** they run Delta-specific tests, **Then** tests interact with actual Spark session and Delta tables, not mocks
3. **Given** the test suite completes, **When** reviewing test results, **Then** the failure count is reduced from 12 to 0 and skip count includes only intentionally disabled tests

### User Story 2 - Operations Team Monitors System Alerts (Priority: P2)

As an operations team member, I need to test and validate that alert configurations work correctly before deploying to production. This requires a local AlertManager instance to verify alert routing, silencing, and notification delivery.

**Why this priority**: Alert reliability is critical for production operations. Testing alert configurations locally before production deployment prevents missed incidents and alert fatigue from misconfigured rules.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending test alerts to AlertManager API and verifying they appear in the AlertManager UI with correct routing, demonstrating alert infrastructure is functional without requiring full Prometheus integration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AlertManager is running in docker-compose, **When** a test alert is sent via API, **Then** the alert appears in AlertManager UI within 5 seconds
2. **Given** alert routing rules are configured, **When** alerts with different severity levels are sent, **Then** each alert routes to the appropriate receiver based on configuration
3. **Given** an alert silence is created, **When** matching alerts are sent, **Then** those alerts are suppressed and marked as silenced in AlertManager

### User Story 3 - QA Engineer Validates MySQL CDC Integration (Priority: P3)

As a QA engineer, I need to run MySQL CDC integration tests to verify that database changes are captured and replicated correctly. Currently, these tests are skipped due to missing MySQL connector library.

**Why this priority**: While infrastructure exists (MySQL + Debezium running), the tests cannot execute due to missing Python package. This is lower priority as it's a simple dependency addition rather than complex infrastructure setup.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing mysql-connector-python and running MySQL CDC tests, demonstrating successful transaction capture without requiring Delta Lake or AlertManager.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** mysql-connector-python is installed, **When** MySQL CDC tests execute, **Then** all 9 test methods run successfully against the dockerized MySQL instance
2. **Given** a bulk insert of 150 records is performed, **When** the CDC capture test runs, **Then** the test verifies all records are captured within the expected timeframe
3. **Given** a transaction with mixed operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is performed, **When** the CDC test validates the final state, **Then** transaction ordering and consistency are preserved

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Spark containers fail to start due to resource constraints (memory/CPU limits)?
- How does the system handle AlertManager being unreachable during test execution?
- What happens if multiple Spark sessions are created concurrently during parallel test execution?
- How are tests affected when docker volumes contain stale Delta Lake metadata from previous test runs?
- What happens when MySQL connector version conflicts with other database libraries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Local development environment MUST include Apache Spark service accessible to test suite
- **FR-002**: Spark service MUST support Delta Lake operations (create tables, write data, read CDF)
- **FR-003**: Local development environment MUST include Prometheus AlertManager service
- **FR-004**: AlertManager MUST be configured with Prometheus as data source for alert evaluation
- **FR-005**: AlertManager MUST expose API and UI for testing alert configurations

### Data Quality Requirements

- **DQ-001**: Delta Lake tests MUST validate data integrity after write operations (row counts, schema validation)
- **DQ-002**: Delta Lake tests MUST verify CDF (Change Data Feed) captures all change events
- **DQ-003**: Delta Lake tests MUST validate schema evolution scenarios (add column, change type, drop column)
- **DQ-004**: MySQL CDC tests MUST verify transaction ordering and consistency
- **DQ-005**: Test cleanup procedures MUST remove all test data from Delta tables and MySQL after execution

### Key Entities

- **Spark Cluster**: Single-node Spark instance with Delta Lake support, provides distributed compute engine for data operations
- **AlertManager Instance**: Prometheus AlertManager service managing alert lifecycle (routing, silencing, notifications)
- **Delta Table**: Versioned data lake table with transaction log, stores CDC events with time-travel capabilities
- **Alert Rule**: Configuration defining condition, severity, and routing for system alerts
- **Test Fixture**: Reusable test setup providing isolated infrastructure instances for each test

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

## Risks & Mitigations *(optional)*

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Spark memory requirements exceed laptop capacity | High - tests cannot run locally | Medium | Configure Spark with conservative memory settings (1GB executor, 1GB driver); document minimum requirements |
| AlertManager tests create alert noise in Grafana | Medium - confusing dashboards | High | Use separate AlertManager instance for tests with isolated receivers; add "test" label to all test alerts |
| Delta Lake concurrent writes cause test flakes | High - unreliable tests | Medium | Use unique table names per test; implement file-based locking; add retry logic with exponential backoff |
| MySQL connector version conflicts | Medium - tests fail to import | Low | Pin mysql-connector-python to specific version in poetry.lock; test compatibility in CI |
| Docker volume cleanup failures leave stale data | Medium - test pollution | High | Implement atomic cleanup in fixtures; add pre-test validation; use docker-compose down -v in Makefile |

## Security Considerations *(optional)*

- **SEC-001**: AlertManager webhook URLs must not contain production credentials
- **SEC-002**: Test alert configurations must not route to production notification channels
- **SEC-003**: Spark UI (port 4040) should only be accessible from localhost
- **SEC-004**: Delta Lake tables in test environment must not contain production data
- **SEC-005**: MySQL test credentials must differ from production credentials
