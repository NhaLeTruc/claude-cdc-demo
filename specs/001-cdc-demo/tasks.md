# Tasks: CDC Demo for Open-Source Data Storage

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-cdc-demo/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: MANDATORY per constitution (TDD enforced) - all tests must be written BEFORE implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below use single project structure per plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Schema Evolution (Phase 8)**: Depends on at least US1 (Postgres CDC) being complete
- **Observability (Phase 9)**: Can start after Foundational, complete before final release
- **Documentation (Phase 10)**: Can start early, complete before final release
- **Final Quality Gates (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories and cross-cutting concerns

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May reference US1 (Postgres CDC) patterns but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (TDD) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Unit tests before integration tests
- Integration tests before e2e tests
- Models/connections before services
- Services before pipelines
- Core implementation before metrics/health checks
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup phase**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003-T008)
- **Foundational phase**: All Docker tasks (T009-T016) can run in parallel, all common utilities (T017-T021) can run in parallel, all schemas (T023-T026) in parallel, all validators (T028-T032) in parallel, all CLI commands (T035-T043) in parallel
- **Within each user story**: All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel, all documentation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Once Foundational phase completes**: All user stories (US1-US5) can start in parallel if team capacity allows
- **Observability phase**: All Grafana dashboards (T141-T144) in parallel, alert rules (T145-T146) in parallel
- **Documentation phase**: All docs (T151-T158) can be written in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Postgres CDC)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD - write these first):
Task: "Unit test for Postgres connection manager in tests/unit/test_cdc_pipelines/test_postgres_connection.py"
Task: "Unit test for Debezium connector config builder in tests/unit/test_cdc_pipelines/test_debezium_config.py"
Task: "Unit test for CDC event parser in tests/unit/test_cdc_pipelines/test_event_parser.py"
Task: "Unit test for DeltaLake writer in tests/unit/test_cdc_pipelines/test_delta_writer.py"

# After tests written and failing, launch all implementation tasks that don't depend on each other:
Task: "Create Postgres connection manager in src/cdc_pipelines/postgres/connection.py"
Task: "Create Debezium connector configuration builder in src/cdc_pipelines/postgres/debezium_config.py"
Task: "Create DeltaLake destination writer in src/cdc_pipelines/postgres/delta_writer.py"
Task: "Implement customers table data generator in src/data_generators/generators.py"
Task: "Implement orders table data generator in src/data_generators/generators.py"

# Documentation can be done in parallel with implementation:
Task: "Create Postgres CDC pipeline README in docs/pipelines/postgres.md"
Task: "Add Postgres CDC architecture diagram in docs/architecture.md"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (8 tasks)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (35 tasks - CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (22 tasks)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: Postgres CDC with Debezium → DeltaLake, fully tested, documented, observable

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (43 tasks)
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP! - 22 tasks)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (19 tasks)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (16 tasks)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (17 tasks)
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (15 tasks)
7. Add Schema Evolution Testing (7 tasks)
8. Complete Observability (10 tasks)
9. Complete Documentation (8 tasks)
10. Final Quality Gates (12 tasks)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (43 tasks)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Postgres CDC) - 22 tasks
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (MySQL CDC) - 19 tasks
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (DeltaLake CDF) - 16 tasks
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Iceberg) - 17 tasks
   - Developer E: Documentation + Observability - 18 tasks
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team collaborates on User Story 5 (cross-storage) - 15 tasks
5. Team completes final quality gates together - 12 tasks

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 178

**Task Breakdown by Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 8 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 35 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Postgres CDC): 22 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - MySQL CDC): 19 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 3 - DeltaLake CDF): 16 tasks
- Phase 6 (User Story 4 - Iceberg CDC): 17 tasks
- Phase 7 (User Story 5 - Cross-Storage): 15 tasks
- Phase 8 (Schema Evolution): 11 tasks (includes 4 new integration tests for schema change types)
- Phase 9 (Observability): 10 tasks
- Phase 10 (Documentation): 8 tasks
- Phase 11 (Quality Gates): 16 tasks (includes 4 new alerting tasks for DQ-008 compliance)

**Parallelizable Tasks**: ~75% of tasks can be executed in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Postgres CDC captures and replicates CRUD operations to DeltaLake
- US2: MySQL CDC captures binlog events and replicates to DeltaLake
- US3: DeltaLake CDF queries return historical change data
- US4: Iceberg incremental reads return changed data between snapshots
- US5: Postgres changes flow through Kafka to Iceberg with transformations

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (Postgres CDC) = 65 tasks total (Setup + Foundational + US1)

**Recent Additions**:
- **T141-T144**: Explicit schema evolution integration tests (ADD/DROP/ALTER/RENAME COLUMN) to address F001 finding
- **T175-T178**: Alerting implementation tasks (Alertmanager + Grafana alerts) to complete DQ-008 coverage (F005 finding)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- TDD enforced: ALL tests must be written BEFORE implementation per constitution
- Tests must FAIL initially, then PASS after implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
