# Feature Specification: CDC Demo for Open-Source Data Storage

**Feature Branch**: `001-cdc-demo`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a change data capture demo project for common open-source data storage solutions. The project should have these qualities: 1. Included with CDC approaches of data storage solutions like Postgres, MySQL, DeltaLake, and Iceberg. 2. Demonstrates all common CDC approaches of each data storage solution. 3. Utilizes only open-source or free tools. 4. Is fully localized using containerization technologies. 5. Generates its own mock data for testing. No real datasource is needed. 6. Follow TDD strictly. Write test before implementations. 7. Follow document as code principles strictly."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Postgres CDC Demonstration (Priority: P1)

A developer or data engineer wants to understand how Change Data Capture works with Postgres by running a local demonstration that captures database changes and streams them to a destination in real-time.

**Why this priority**: Postgres is one of the most widely used open-source databases, and understanding its CDC mechanisms (logical replication, write-ahead logs) is fundamental for data engineering teams building real-time data pipelines.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the Postgres CDC pipeline, inserting/updating/deleting records in a source table, and verifying that all changes appear in the destination with correct timestamps and operation types (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Postgres CDC pipeline is running with a source table containing initial data, **When** a new record is inserted, **Then** the change appears in the destination within 5 seconds with operation type "INSERT"
2. **Given** an existing record in the Postgres source table, **When** the record is updated, **Then** both the old and new values are captured in the destination with operation type "UPDATE"
3. **Given** an existing record in the Postgres source table, **When** the record is deleted, **Then** the deletion is captured in the destination with operation type "DELETE" and includes the deleted record's key
4. **Given** the Postgres CDC pipeline encounters a schema change (new column added), **When** data is inserted with the new schema, **Then** the schema change is detected and logged appropriately

### User Story 2 - MySQL CDC Demonstration (Priority: P2)

A developer or data engineer wants to explore MySQL's binlog-based CDC by running a local demonstration that captures MySQL database changes and replicates them to a destination.

**Why this priority**: MySQL is another critical open-source database with unique CDC mechanisms (binlog replication). After understanding Postgres CDC, learning MySQL CDC provides comparative insights into different CDC architectures.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the MySQL CDC pipeline, performing CRUD operations on a source table, and verifying that binlog events are correctly parsed and replicated to the destination.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the MySQL CDC pipeline is running with binlog enabled, **When** a transaction commits multiple changes (INSERT + UPDATE), **Then** all changes appear in the destination in the correct order
2. **Given** a MySQL table with various data types (VARCHAR, INT, DATETIME, JSON), **When** records are inserted, **Then** all data types are correctly captured and preserved in the destination
3. **Given** the MySQL CDC pipeline is running, **When** a large batch of changes occurs (100+ records), **Then** all changes are captured without data loss

---

### User Story 3 - DeltaLake CDC Demonstration (Priority: P3)

A data engineer wants to understand DeltaLake's Change Data Feed feature by running a demonstration that tracks changes across table versions and queries historical change data.

**Why this priority**: DeltaLake represents modern lakehouse architectures. Its CDC approach differs from traditional databases (version-based rather than log-based), making it important for data lake practitioners.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by writing data to a DeltaLake table with Change Data Feed enabled, creating multiple versions through updates/deletes, and querying the change data feed to retrieve all historical changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a DeltaLake table with Change Data Feed enabled, **When** records are updated across multiple commits, **Then** each version's changes are retrievable through the change data feed
2. **Given** a DeltaLake table with historical changes, **When** querying the change feed for a specific time range, **Then** only changes within that time range are returned
3. **Given** a DeltaLake table with deletes and updates, **When** querying the change feed, **Then** operation types (insert/update/delete) are correctly identified

---

### User Story 4 - Iceberg CDC Demonstration (Priority: P4)

A data engineer wants to explore Apache Iceberg's incremental read capabilities by running a demonstration that tracks data changes using Iceberg's snapshot metadata.

**Why this priority**: Iceberg is gaining adoption in modern data platforms. Understanding its CDC approach (snapshot-based incremental reads) completes the coverage of major open-source data storage solutions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by writing data to an Iceberg table, creating snapshots through updates, and performing incremental reads to retrieve only changed data between snapshots.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Iceberg table with multiple snapshots, **When** performing an incremental read between two snapshots, **Then** only the changed rows are returned
2. **Given** an Iceberg table with partition evolution, **When** data is written with a new partitioning scheme, **Then** incremental reads handle the schema evolution correctly
3. **Given** an Iceberg table with mixed operations (inserts, updates, deletes), **When** querying changes between snapshots, **Then** all change types are identifiable

---

### User Story 5 - Cross-Storage CDC Pipeline (Priority: P5)

A developer wants to see an end-to-end demonstration where changes from a relational database (Postgres) are captured and replicated to a data lake table (Iceberg or DeltaLake) via CDC.

**Why this priority**: Real-world use cases often involve moving data from OLTP databases to analytical data lakes. This demonstrates practical CDC application patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by inserting data into Postgres, verifying the CDC pipeline captures changes, and confirming the data appears in the destination Iceberg/DeltaLake table with correct transformations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Postgres-to-Iceberg CDC pipeline is running, **When** data is inserted into Postgres, **Then** the data appears in the Iceberg table within 10 seconds
2. **Given** a Postgres table with updates, **When** the CDC pipeline processes the changes, **Then** the Iceberg table reflects the latest state with correct upsert semantics
3. **Given** the CDC pipeline encounters schema drift (new column in Postgres), **Then** the pipeline logs the schema change and handles it gracefully

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a CDC pipeline restarts after a failure? (Should resume from last committed offset)
- How does the system handle schema changes that are incompatible (e.g., column type change from INT to VARCHAR)?
- What happens when the destination is temporarily unavailable? (Should buffer changes or fail gracefully with retry)
- How does the system handle large transactions (1000+ row updates in a single transaction)?
- What happens when there are concurrent updates to the same record?
- How does the system handle data with special characters, unicode, or binary data?
- What happens when CDC lag exceeds acceptable thresholds? (Should alert or log warnings)
