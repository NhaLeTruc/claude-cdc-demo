# Specification Quality Checklist: CDC Demo for Open-Source Data Storage

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed
**Validated**: 2025-10-27
**Result**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

### Validation Details

- **Content Quality**: All 4 checks passed
- **Requirement Completeness**: All 8 checks passed
- **Feature Readiness**: All 4 checks passed
- **Total**: 16/16 checks passed (100%)

### Key Strengths

1. Clear user-focused scenarios for each storage type (Postgres, MySQL, DeltaLake, Iceberg)
2. Comprehensive requirements covering functional, data quality, and operational aspects
3. Measurable success criteria with specific metrics (time, throughput, reliability)
4. Well-defined scope with 5 independent user stories prioritized for incremental delivery
5. Thorough edge case identification covering failure scenarios and data quality concerns

## Notes

- No issues found - specification is ready for planning phase
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning
